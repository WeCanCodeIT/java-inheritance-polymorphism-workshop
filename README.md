# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## What is inheritance?

> When you design with inheritance, you put common code in a class
and then tell other more specific classes that the common (more abstract) 
class is their superclass.  **When one class inherits from another, 
the subclass inherits from the superclass.** 
> -Head First Java, page 168

## Why should I use inheritance?
- Declare variable only once, reassign objects many times. 
- Reduces amount of code written.
- Provides a powerful tool for abstraction.

## How do I use inheritance?
- The `extends` keyword.
- The `@Override` annotation.
- Shared information and encapsulation.
- Using abstract super classes.
- *Is A* design decisions.
